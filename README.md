# JavaRush_Module-1
#### Final course work on module 1. Working with cryptography

This is an educational application based on Java Swing.
According to the `task №1` - can encrypt and decrypt files based on the Caesar cipher.
According to `task №2`, is able to decrypt text using a brute force algorithm, as well as static text analysis,
based on the received example.

At the start of the application, 3 main classes with a user interface are involved.
`StartGUI` , `EncryptionGUI`, `CryptAnalyzerGUI`.
The config file `config\Enviroment.java` contains text fields and the alphabet that the program will use.

For task number 1, the following classes are used:
- EncryptFile.java
- DecryptFile.java
- СryptEngine.java

For task number 2, the following classes are used:
- BruteForceFile.java
- BruteForceEngine.java
- StatisticFile.java
- StatisticEngine.java
- StatisticFile.java

The `example` directory contains a file and two templates to use when testing the application.
